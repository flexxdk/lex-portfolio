							<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
							<p class="major">Hello, and welcome! My name is Lex de Kort and on this website you can browse through some of the projects I have made over the years.</p>
							<h2>More about myself</h2>
							<p class="major">I was born in the Netherlands in 1992, and grew up in the city of Helmond. As a child, I did not have many friends. Instead, I spent a lot of time with computers and consoles. They, together with television, were the main form of entertainment for me while growing up, and as such I grew fascinated with them. By the time I was 16 I had decided to pursue a career in IT over a chef career.</p>
							<p class="major">After finishing HAVO, I went to MBO where I first studied Game Development. I ended up switching to Web Development halfway through because I felt that web dev suited me better. I ended up interning at Gynzy as a Flash developer, where I continued working for them part-time after my internship had ended.<p>
							<p class="major">By that point, a lot happened in my private life that prevented me from continuing onwards. This, combined with my contract at Gynzy ending, lead to me taking a long personal break to try and figure out what it is that I really want to do with my life.</p>
							<p class="major">By 2020, I had decided that I wanted to go back to school and follow a course in either Computer Science or Software Engineering. In the end, I settled upon Software Engineering. Because of COVID-19, I had to postpone my plans til 2021, which is when I signed up for HBO ICT & Software Engineering at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.</p>
							<p class="major">I have already learned so much about sofware engineering in these two years, more than I was ever taught in my six years at MBO. The industry is so broad, filled with so many opportunities and different cultures, I have no regrets about doing software engineering.</p>

							<h2>Tournament Manager Application</h2>
							<p>In semester 2 we had to develop a tournament management system with C# within the .NET stack. It consists of a WinForms application serving as the back-end and a website built on ASP.NET Core Razor pages as the front-end.</p>
							<p>The project itself had several requirements that it had to meet, such as different rulesets for different sports, a leaderboard functionality on the front-end, tournament schedule generation, and general CRUD functionality. There was also emphasis on maintainability and extendability.</p>
							<p> For starters, the application had to support different rulesets for different sports (for example, a tennis match cannot have a score of 75 - 83, whereas another sport might). Another requirement was a leaderboard functionality on the front-end. Beyond that</p>

							<h2>Student Housing Application (Roomies)</h2>
							<p>In semester 3 we had to develop an application using Java with Spring Framework for our back-end and ReactJS for our front-end. I decided to create an application for student housing, dubbed Roomies.</p>
							<p>The idea came from my fellow student's frustrations with finding student housing. Listings were often unclear or not detailed enough. Some companies even list rooms that are already taken, which often leads to frustration. The purpose of the website was to alleviate these issues by giving the process more clarity and to give students more tools to communicate with landlords.</p>
							<p>The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of full-stack software engineering, how to apply SOLID principles to software, being able to Dockerize our application, and learning how to set up a pipeline with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with automatic testing using SonarQube and Cypress.</p>

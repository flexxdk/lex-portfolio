							<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
							<p class="major">Hello, and welcome! My name is Lex de Kort and on this website you can browse through some of the projects I have made over the years.</p>
							<h2>More about myself</h2>
							<p class="major">I was born in the Netherlands in 1992, and grew up in the city of Helmond. As a child, I did not have many friends. Instead, I spent a lot of time with computers and consoles. They, together with television, were the main form of entertainment for me while growing up, and as such I grew fascinated with them. By the time I was 16 I had decided to pursue a career in IT over a chef career.</p>
							<p class="major">After finishing HAVO, I went to MBO where I first studied Game Development. I ended up switching to Web Development halfway through because I felt that web dev suited me better. I ended up interning at Gynzy as a Flash developer, where I continued working for them part-time after my internship had ended.<p>
							<p class="major">After my time at Gynzy, I wanted something new. After figuring out what it was that I wanted to do, I set my sights on my new path: to go back to school and follow a course in either Computer Science or Software Engineering. In the end, I settled upon Software Engineering. Because of COVID-19, I had to postpone my plans til 2021, which is when I signed up for HBO ICT & Software Engineering at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.</p>
							<p class="major">I have already learned so much about sofware engineering in these two years, more than I was ever taught in my six years at MBO. The industry is so broad, filled with so many opportunities and different cultures, I have no regrets about doing software engineering.</p>

							<h2>CloudBord - an online whiteboard collaboration application</h2>
							<p>In semester 6 I decided to develop a collaborative whiteboard application hosted in the cloud. The technology stack consists of multiple microservices built with .NET Azure Functions and an Ocelot API gateway. The front-end is built with Next.js & TypeScript, and makes use of Auth.js for Keycloak connectivity. The application itself is hosted on Azure.</p>
							<p>The main goal of the project was understanding the importance of non-functional requirements, how we as software engineers can analyze these requirements, and how we can utilize the right technologies to meet these requirements.</p>
							<p>Developing the whiteboard application taught me a lot about structuring larger applications and how to best connect different technologies and systems together into a cohesive whole. One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to synchronize whiteboard contents between multiple users, which while tough was also fun to figure out.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, I no longer have credits left on Azure so I can no longer run the Cloudbord application. However, I did record a few videos at several milestones in the project and have attached them down below.</p>

							<h2>Student Housing Application (Roomies)</h2>
							<p>In semester 3 we had to develop an application using Java with Spring Framework for our back-end and ReactJS for our front-end. I decided to create an application for student housing, dubbed Roomies.</p>
							<p>The idea came from my fellow student's frustrations with finding student housing. Listings were often unclear or not detailed enough. Some companies even list rooms that are already taken, which often leads to frustration. The purpose of the website was to alleviate these issues by giving the process more clarity and to give students more tools to communicate with landlords.</p>
							<p>The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of full-stack software engineering, how to apply SOLID principles to software, being able to Dockerize our application, and learning how to set up a pipeline with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with automatic testing using SonarQube and Cypress.</p>

							<h2>Programmable Robot Tool & Long Division Tool</h2>
							<p>I made a lot of tools over the course of my time at Gynzy. While the source code is gone, I was able to obtain a few video's of the tools I was most proud of, courtesy of Gynzy.</p>
							<p>Both tools had different goals that they sought to accomplish. The goal of the programmable robot tool was to give students a first experience with basic programming using command blocks. The goal of the long division tool was to visualize the process of the long division method and its many different iterations.</p>
							<p>Both tools were quite complex to develop, with the long division tool taking up a lot of time comparatively, as it sought to tackle a complex issue. While the pogrammable robot tool did not take up quite as much time, it was still a project that had a lot of thought behind it in terms of how to approach the project.</p>
							<p>I greatly enjoyed my time at Gynzy, and I learned a lot from them. I am very happy that I had the opportunity to expand my skills there.</p>
